1-First of all try to install CoppeliaSim (V-REP) Software:\
The free version is the Educational one. DownLoad from this [link](https://coppeliarobotics.com/downloads#) and install.

2-Open [vrep_test_scene.ttt](https://github.com/98210184/Quadcopter-PID-Control-in-V-REP/blob/main/Quadcopter%20PID%20Control%20in%20V-REP%20simolator/vrep_test_scene.ttt) for quadcopter using installed software.

In this file your python IDE will be connected to CoppeliSim if not
- Try to connect python and CoppeliaSim with finding your server IP (usually 19999 if not 19997)
- see this [link](https://forum.coppeliarobotics.com/viewtopic.php?t=6156)
