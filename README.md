# Quadcopter-PID-Control-in-V-REP

# How to Run:


1-First of all try to install CoppeliaSim (V-REP) Software:\
The free version is the Educational one. DownLoad from this [link](https://coppeliarobotics.com/downloads#) and install.

2-Open [`vrep_test_scene.ttt`](https://github.com/98210184/Quadcopter-PID-Control-in-V-REP/blob/main/Quadcopter%20PID%20Control%20in%20V-REP%20simolator/vrep_test_scene.ttt) for quadcopter using installed software.

3- Try to change these features in the CoppeliaSim environmant:
  - Change the Simulation Time Step (dt) to 10ms
  - Change the Dynamics Engine to `Newtonian`
  - Change the Dynamics Setting to `very accurate`

4- Run [`Main.py`](https://github.com/98210184/Quadcopter-PID-Control-in-V-REP/blob/main/Quadcopter%20PID%20Control%20in%20V-REP%20simolator/main.py)

In this file, your Python IDE will be connected to CoppeliSim if not
- Try to connect Python and CoppeliaSim by finding your server IP (usually 19999 if not 19997)
- see this [link](https://forum.coppeliarobotics.com/viewtopic.php?t=6156)

5- PID gains have been tuned. If you are not satisfied with the results, try to change the gains in your way.

6- Enjoy!
